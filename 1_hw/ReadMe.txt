notes: The first two were easy. The Last one kept making me think of parallel programming. I couldn't for the life of me figure out the indexing. Also, new/malloc stuff was a tad confusing as it originally went to all zeroes then i had garbage numbers. Had I actually tried working it out rather than hacking at it I think I could've finished triMatMult in 2hrs.
